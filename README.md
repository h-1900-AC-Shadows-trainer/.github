## 🧠 What Is the AC Shadows Trainer?

A **trainer** is basically a standalone app that runs alongside your game and lets you activate cheats in real-time. It modifies the game’s memory while it’s running, so you can flip on god mode, refill stamina, or boost your XP bar without restarting or messing with files.

This one is **built exclusively for Assassin’s Creed Shadows**, meaning it's tuned perfectly for its mechanics, stealth systems, and combat flow.
